Welcome to my Data Science Projects Portfolio! This portfolio is a collection of my work in data science, highlighting my skills and expertise across various domains. Each project here exemplifies different facets of data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization, demonstrating my ability to transform raw data into actionable insights and predictive models. Dive in to explore how I tackle complex problems, employ cutting-edge techniques, and present data-driven solutions with clarity and precision.

## Projects

1. [Car Insurance Sales Prediction](https://github.com/bebe5004/Eunbin-Yoo-s-Portfolio/tree/main/Car%20Insurance%20Sales%20Prediction)

* **Description**: The project predicts whether a health insurance customer will also be interested in vehicle insurance.
* **Technologies Used**: The notebooks showcases data visualizations using python libraries such as matplotlib and seaborn, and uses Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, XGBoost Classifier and Light Gradient Boosting Classifier.
* **Results**: The Light Gradient Boosting Model performs the best with AUC score of 86%.

2. [Car Insurance Customer Segmentation](https://github.com/bebe5004/Eunbin-Yoo-s-Portfolio/tree/main/Car%20Insurance%20Customer%20Segmentation%20Analysis)

Description: The project conducts a segmentation analysis and determines the optimal number of clusters for health insurance customers who are also interested in vehicle insurance.
Technologies Used: The notebooks showcases data visualizations using python libraries such as matplotlib and seaborn, and uses K-means Clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
Results: In terms of business related variables, the optimal number of cluster is 4. In terms of demographic related variables, the optimal number is 7.
