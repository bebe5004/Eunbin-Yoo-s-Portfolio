## Projects

1. [Netflix EDA](https://github.com/bebe5004/Eunbin-Yoo-s-Portfolio/tree/main/Netflix%20EDA)

* **Description**: This project aims to conduct an exploratory data analysis on Netflix's content library that would help the media company make informed business decisions.
* **Technologies Used**: The notebooks showcases data visualizations using Python libraries such as matplotlib, seaborn and plotly.

2. [Movie Recommender System](https://github.com/bebe5004/Eunbin-Yoo-s-Portfolio/tree/main/Movie%20Recommender%20System)

* **Description**: The aim of this project is to develop a content-based recommender system that recommends similar movies to a user's input, by analyzing textual features such as title, genre, description, keywords and credits.
* **Technologies Used**: The notebooks uses Count Vectorizer, Porter Stemmer, Cosine Similarity and Streamlit library.
* **Results**: Successfully built a recommender algorithm that produces a list of 5 recommended movies and deployed the model as a web application using Streamlit

3. [Life Expectancy Prediction](https://github.com/bebe5004/Eunbin-Yoo-s-Portfolio/tree/main/Life%20Expectancy%20Prediction)

* **Description**: The aim of this project is to predict life expectancy of a country, by analyzing various demographic, socio-economic and health variables, and investigate variables that has the most impact on life expectancy.
* **Technologies Used**: The notebooks showcases data visualizations using Python libraries such as matplotlib, seaborn, plotly and folium, and uses Linear Regression, Lasso Regression and Random Forest.
* **Results**: The Random Forest Model performs the best with Mean squared error (MSE) of 4.10.

4. [Car Insurance Sales Prediction](https://github.com/bebe5004/Eunbin-Yoo-s-Portfolio/tree/main/Car%20Insurance%20Sales%20Prediction)

* **Description**: The project predicts whether a health insurance customer will also be interested in vehicle insurance.
* **Technologies Used**: The notebooks showcases data visualizations using Python libraries such as matplotlib and seaborn, and uses Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, XGBoost Classifier and Light Gradient Boosting Classifier.
* **Results**: The Light Gradient Boosting Model performs the best with AUC score of 86%.

5. [Car Insurance Customer Segmentation](https://github.com/bebe5004/Eunbin-Yoo-s-Portfolio/tree/main/Car%20Insurance%20Customer%20Segmentation%20Analysis)

* **Description**: The project conducts a segmentation analysis and determines the optimal number of clusters for health insurance customers who are also interested in vehicle insurance.
* **Technologies Used**: The notebooks showcases data visualizations using Python libraries such as matplotlib and seaborn, and uses K-means Clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
* **Results**: In terms of business related variables, the optimal number of cluster is 4. In terms of demographic related variables, the optimal number is 7.
