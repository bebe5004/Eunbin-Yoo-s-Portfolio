## Project Overview

There are much more factors that influence the value of a house than we think. This data science project aims to predict house prices using a dataset that includes various features and attributes of residential properties. Through data analysis and modeling, the project seeks to create a predictive model that can accurately estimate house sale prices.

The primary goal of this project is to use machine learning techniques to develop a house price estimation model. By training the model on historical data and utilizing the patterns and relationships it learns, the model will be able to accurately predict the prices of new or unseen houses.

## Dataset Information

The dataset used in this project consists of information about different residential properties. It includes a wide range of features that can potentially influence the price of a house, such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, location, neighborhood characteristics, and other relevant factors. Here's the information about the first 10 variables of the dataset.

## Approach

The project will involve several steps, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation. Techniques such as data cleaning, handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables will be employed to prepare the dataset for model training. Various regression algorithms, such as linear regression, random forests will be explored and evaluated to determine the most suitable model for accurate price prediction.

## Impact

Accurate house price predictions can significantly impact homebuyers, sellers, real estate agents, and investors. A robust predictive model enables prospective buyers to make well-informed property investment choices, helps sellers set competitive prices, and allows agents to provide more accurate advice to their clients. Investors can also utilize predicted prices to spot profitable opportunities in the real estate market.

This project seeks to reveal insights and patterns within the housing market, enhancing the understanding of factors that influence house prices and supporting more informed decision-making in the real estate sector.
