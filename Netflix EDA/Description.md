## Project Overview

Founded in 1997, Netflix is American subscription video over-the-top streaming service and production company with over 192M subscribers worldwide! As of mid-2021, Netflix has over 8000 movies and TV shows available from a wide variety of genres on their platform. So, for content producers to promote their content more effectively, it is crucial to understand the trends of the content that Netflix adds to their catalog. What has been the trend in Netflix streaming in recent years? What type of content is popular on Netflix? 

This project aims to conduct an exploratory data analysis on Netflix's content library and investigate what content should be bought or produced for 'Youflix', a hypothetical streaming service.

## Dataset Information

The dataset for this analysis was downloaded from Netflix Movies and TV Shows Data uploaded Kaggle via Public Domain. This dataset was made available through Shivam Bansal on Kaggle.

## Approach

The project will involve data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis and data visualizations using matplotlib and seaborn. Techniques such as data cleaning, handling missing values and encoding categorical variables will be employed to enhance the effectiveness of the analysis. Thereafter, recommendations will be suggested based on the findings from analysis for media companies to incorporate in their content strategy and marketing.

## Impact

Given Netflix's dominant position in the streaming market and entertainment industry, exploratory data analysis on Netflix's content library can greatly benefit media producers. By analyzing Netflix's diverse content, companies can develop strategies aligned with viewer preferences, enhancing engagement and market share.
